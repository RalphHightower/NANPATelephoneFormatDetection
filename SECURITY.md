# Reporting Security Issues

To report a security issue, please email [ralph.hightower+nanpa-sec@gmail.com](mailto:ralph.hightower+nanpa-sec@gmail.com)
with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue,
affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue.

I respond within 3 working days of your email. If the issue is confirmed as a vulnerability,
I will open a Security Advisory and acknowledge your contributions as part of it. This project
follows a 90 day disclosure timeline.
